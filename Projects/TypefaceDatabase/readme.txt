TYPEFACE DATABASE

This is simple Excel file that contains metdata for a number of typefaces.

Metadata includes:
	Typeface name
	Designer
	Year Created
	Designers
	Wikipedia Link


My criteria for including a typeface: 
- Noteworthy in the field 
- Historical significance 
- People see or use it often 
- Personal interest

The data is incomplete, but is reasonably accurate. 

Feel free to use it in your projects. Feel even more free to suggest improvements and corrections.

Sources of the data:
- Wikipedia
- Periodic Table of Typefaces (http://www.squidspot.com/Periodic_Table_of_Typefaces.html)
